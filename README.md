# PDF-Table-to-TSV
Java GUI so that you can extract tables from PDFs without entering the info by hand.

It gets 90% of the job done, but depending on your data you'll need to fix some stuff yourself

## Instructions
1. Copy/paste your table into the text area
1. Enter a valid path to your output file. Make sure it has either ".tsv" or ".TSV" as the file extension
1. You're set! Now you can open it using any spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, or Google Spreadsheets.
